At least one lab per week is to be submitted.

How to submit lab:

	Send an email:
		To: sldeskins@gmail.com
		Subject: GC Submit 
		
		Body: Contains a link to the github repository where the lab is saved
		
		OR
		
		a zip file of the lab solution
	(Note: Gmail does not like '.zip' extension.  Rename the extension part to '.zzz')





Lab Submission Process Update


The process is still shaking down.

 - Issues that came up
   - how to get them to the reviewer, i.e. email to sldeskins@gmail.com  with 'GC Submit' in the subject

   - what to put in the email
     a link to where it is on github
	 Note: Sometimes git repository on one's local machine have not be 'synced' with the repository on github
	 
	 OR
	 
	 attach a zip file. 
	 Note: Some mail provider may not like sending '.zip' files. Rename the 'zip' part to something else like '.zip111'
	 Note: What to attach or zip, was not defined clearly enough. Projects and solutions contain more than one file.
	       Sending a single file does not work well for the reviewer in most cases.
